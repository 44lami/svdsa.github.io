The SVDSA is ready to start putting together regular General Meetings.
These would be regular events, probably 60 to 90 minutes, likely held twice per
month.  To try and narrow down a time and place for these meetings, we've put
together a short [survey][survey] to get your feedback on when and where works
for the most people.
