The SVDSA is ready to put together a schedule of General Meetings! These would
be regular events, probably 60 to 90 minutes, likely held twice per month. We'd
hear from members reporting back from recent events, and work together on new
events for the future. Good old fashioned organization stuff.

To try and narrow down a time and place for these meetings, we've put
together a short [survey][survey] to get your feedback on when and where works
for the most people.
