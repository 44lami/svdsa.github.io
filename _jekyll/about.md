The Silicon Valley Democratic Socialists of America are a branch of the
[South Bay Democratic Socialists of America][sbdsa].  We meet biweekly,
organizing to bring about a democratic economy and a just society: for the bay,
for California, and for the U.S.A.

of our general meetings or social shindigs.
